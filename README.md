#### Currently, Firebase has been connected to the project. I have sent you invites via email [The emails put in the project proposal] so you can edit the Firebase
#### I know some deprecated APIs are being used. I've been wanting to change it, but whenever I do, the project will no longer run. I'll try and fix it soon
#### In Firebase, it is already certified by using SHA-1. Though the Authorized domains are still set to default.
#### The UI is simple as of now. I am currently working on creating the database using Cloud Firestore, which is connected to Firebase, so 
#### you can see it there. The google-services.json is also listed here with the information on our app.
